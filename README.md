# niki.ai---Internship--Backend-Assignment
Synopsis

Recently Manu visited the byteland. He was amazed with lots of different varieties of bytes he
encountered there. Seeing this, he thought of a problem: Given an integer n, find out total possible
bit string (either 0 or 1) of length n which don't have two contiguous zeroes in them. For example if n
= 3, then total possible bit strings are 5 {010, 011, 101, 110, 111}. Now Manu started solving 
the problem but got busy with some important deployments. He asked you for the help. Please help
him figure out the solution.


Logic 
    Upon mathematical analysis, discovered a pattern that number of possible bit sequences of a particular length following above criteria
    follow a fabonacii series.

Execution
